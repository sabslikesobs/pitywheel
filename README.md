# Wheel of Fortune Tracker + Guarantee

This mod for Balatro will either:

- Track your Nope! rate for The Wheel of Fortune, adding metrics to the card display, or
- Guarantee the "1 in 4" success rate for The Wheel of Fortune, such that The Wheel cannot Nope! you more than 3 times in a row

The metrics reset when Balatro.exe launches and aren't saved. Starting a new game will not affect the tracker. Want persistent metrics? [@Norad74] has a fork for that:

> If you want the wheel stats to be saved between game sessions, download
> PityWheel.lua and wheel_save.txt from https://github.com/Norad74/pitywheel.
> Put PityWheel.lua in your mods folder and wheel_save.txt in your
> %appdata%/Balatro folder.
